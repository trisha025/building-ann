# building-first-ann from the course Deep Learning (A-Z)

It is using Keras (Using TensorFlow Backend) i.e. building the NN based on TensorFlow.
Steps to be followed are:

1. Building ANN
-Import important libraries (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas)
-Dataset
-Encoding Categorical Data (if needed)
-Splitting Data into Train and Test
-Feature Scaling

2. Building ANN
-Import Keras and Models (Sequential, Dense)

3. Initialising ANN (Two ways: Defining as a sequence of layers or defining a graph)
-Creating object from Sequential class (classifier)
-Adding layers (input and hidden)

4. Adding final layer

5. Compiling ANN (SGD applied)

6. Choosing the number of epochs
-Fitting the ANN to training set

7. Making predictions (initialising the threshold)

8. Confusion Matrix and Accuracy
